Audiophile

A music visualizer written in Processing with pretty colors

This is as close to pure-Processing as I could get, without ditching the audio processing itself. It can't be run with Processing.js because it relies on Minim, but it can be run without any external libraries or dependencies with Processing.

If you don't know what that means, then you're probably still fine... just attach a microphone to your computer, open this in Processing, and play some music into the microphone!
